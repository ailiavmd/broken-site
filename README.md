# broken-site
This site is a mess. It has an index.html file and a script.js file but the code is wonky and there is no style.css sheet.

The js file contains broken JavaScript that should change the background colour of the body from the buttons. There is also an interval there that changes the source of the image to one of three images every 3 seconds. 

The CSS file doesn't exist but you you should create one to add a bit of style to the page as demonstrated in complete.jpg.

There are no images in the img folder except for complete.jpg which shows that the website must look like when CSS is added. You will need to find 3 other images to use in the image slide show. You can change the name of the images in the JS file to whatever you want.

The index.html page is severly broken with poor code. It needs to be fixed.
